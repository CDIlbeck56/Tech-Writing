#How I Approach Writing

I like to start all my writing projects with research. For me it is very important that I have a good understaing of the topic and task at hand. I start all my writing projects on paper first. I sart by brain storming or witing down my initial thoughts. Once I feeel that I have grasped and idea, I sart an outline. After I outline my ideas, I write amd rivise.
