I learned how to navigate through wordpress. For me, building the site was the hardest part of the assigment. I felt pretty confident about my blog posts. However, the one thing i struggled with was making my writing catchy. I feel like I had a good idea of what I wanted to talk about but maybe didn't present it in a flashy enough way to catch my auidence.
