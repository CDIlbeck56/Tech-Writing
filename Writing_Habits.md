I outline my writing before I start. The hardest part of writing is starting the paper. I have to have a good idea of what I am writing about, who it's to, what's it's for, and how I am going to organize my thoughts. Once I have it outlined, I start on the rough draft and write as much as I can if I am in the mood. If I am in the grove and have started the process, I try not to stop because if I do I know that I am easily destracrted. After I write the rough draft, I revise and look for things to add. I like to have someone look over my work several times and get feedback.

I need to stop procrastinating and just get the rough draft started. Once I get the process staring my writing anxiety statrs to go away.

I work really hard and put alot of time into my papers. I am not affraid to seek help and to gain someone elses opinion. I think seeking help helps reinsure my writing.
